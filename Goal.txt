I want to become a front end developer paired with my backend laravel skills. I want to learn React and Vue for this year by June 2025 so I can apply to these full stack jobs.

I want to be able to build
üêæ PetAdopt PH ‚Äì A Simple Pet Adoption Platform
Core Features (MVP)
‚úÖ Browse Pets for Adoption ‚Äì Users can view a list of adoptable pets with photos, descriptions, and location.
‚úÖ Post Pets for Adoption ‚Äì Pet owners/shelters can create listings with pet details (name, age, breed, location, etc.).
‚úÖ Adoption Requests ‚Äì Interested adopters can send inquiries via a simple request form.
‚úÖ User Authentication ‚Äì Sign up/login with email & password (or social login via Google/Facebook).
‚úÖ Admin Panel (Basic) ‚Äì Manage pet listings and user accounts (approve/delete listings).
